# Matlab-code-for-Emergent-QM

1.use density_generatedata to generate the potential and density data for RNN.

2.use DENSITY_RNN_ADAM to learn a RNN mapping from potential to density.

3.use DATAforRNNAE to generate the potential and hidden state data for AERNN.

4.use AERNN to extract knowledage from the first RNN.
